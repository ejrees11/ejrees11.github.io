        <p class="text-secondary leading-relaxed">
          ISYE 649- My team and I worked all semester to create an interactive dashboard for researchers to viualize and explore their EEG data.
            Our final product, linked <a href="https://spenceleyy.shinyapps.io/Working_Draft_of_Final_Project/" target="_blank" class="underline">here</a>, 
          was created as a Shiny app through R Studio, and features numerous data visualization
          techniques we had learned.  It allows for the input of one's own EEG data, cap arrangement, or brain model with very simple adjustments
          within the code.  This dashboard is currently in use by the Neuroergonomics Lab at UW-Madison for easy visibility to their EEG results.

        <p class="text-secondary leading-relaxed">
          ISYE 510- Given minimal information about a series of LCD screen products and their manufacturing process, my team and I were tasked with 
          designing a new facility and operational plan to best suite the company.  Through cell formation, nodal diagramming, systematic
          layout planning, and the CRAFT method, as well as numerous other analyses, we designed a full facility and headquarters for the company,
          which increased efficency and profits by over 4 million dollars annually over three years.

        <p class="text-secondary leading-relaxed">
          INTEREGR 397- In this project, I worked individually to highlight the lackluster nature of American passenger rail systems.  I was motivated
          by a heavily elayed experience that left me wondering why our standards and systems are so different from other nations.  Through this
           project, I advocated for and eventually designed a network model that maximized train flow through a series of constricted nodes and arcs designed
          to represent real life train traffic across passenger and freight railways.  The project featured numerous oral presentations to engineers
          aross many disciplines who all provided feedback as it related to their own field, further strengthening the case for implementation of a similar
          system by railways nationwide.

          Neuroergonomics Lab- See experience tab for more information!  I worked with an extremely talented team focused on human-robot interaction
          , a growing field in both industry and academia.  My work was specifically focused on bioinsturmentation and quantification of education level
          /prior knowledge and it's influence on the participants reactions.  Subjective and objective measures were used to get extremely comprehensive
           understandings of over 40 study participants we worked with.
